# Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect fake news articles based on their text content. It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques like TF-IDF vectorization and a Logistic Regression model to classify the news as fake or real.

## Overview

- Preprocessed and cleaned news text data
- Applied stemming and TF-IDF vectorization
- Trained a Logistic Regression model using Scikit-learn
- Achieved 97.3% accuracy in predicting fake news
- Built using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Sklearn

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Fake and Real News Dataset** available on [Kaggle]
Once downloaded, place the dataset file (e.g., `Fake.csv`, `True.csv`) in the working directory.

## Requirements

- Python 3.13
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

You can install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
